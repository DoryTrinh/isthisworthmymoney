You know you should budget. Everyone says so. But sitting down with a spreadsheet feels like homework — and the last thing you need after a long day is more homework.

That's where budget calculators come in. A good one takes the friction out of managing your money: you plug in a few numbers, and it shows you where you stand. No accounting degree required.

But there are dozens of them out there, and they're not all built for the same purpose. Some track every transaction. Some just tell you how to split your paycheck. And some help you answer the question most people actually have: *can I afford this thing I want to buy?*

Here are five of the best free options available right now, what each one does well, and which one fits your situation.

## What makes a good budget calculator?

Before we compare tools, here's what separates a useful calculator from a forgettable one:

* **It answers a specific question.** The best tools don't try to do everything. They help you answer one thing clearly — whether that's "how should I split my income?" or "is this purchase worth it?"
* **It's fast.** If it takes more than 2 minutes to get a useful result, most people will close the tab.
* **It doesn't require an account.** The lower the barrier, the better. You should be able to get value before signing up for anything.
* **It gives you something actionable.** A number by itself isn't helpful. A good calculator tells you what to *do* with that number.
* **It works on your phone.** Most money decisions happen on the go — standing in a store, scrolling through an online shop, splitting a bill with friends.

With that in mind, here's how five popular free tools stack up.

## 1. Is This Worth My Money?

**Best for:** Deciding whether a specific purchase is worth it

Most budget tools focus on tracking what you've already spent. [Is This Worth My Money?](https://isthisworthmymoney.com) flips that around — it helps you decide *before* you spend.

It has three calculators. One for things you buy regularly (like your daily coffee or a streaming subscription), one for bigger purchases you're considering, and one that breaks down your entire monthly expenses. You plug in the cost, your income, and it shows you how that spending choice affects your financial picture over time.

What makes it different is the framing. Instead of showing you a pie chart of categories, it answers the question most people are actually asking: *"Can I afford this? And is it worth it for me?"*

### What's good

* No account needed — you get results immediately
* Three focused calculators instead of one generic tool
* Shows long-term impact of purchases, not just the sticker price
* Clean, simple interface that works well on mobile

### What's missing

* No bank syncing or automatic transaction tracking
* Doesn't replace a full budgeting app if you need ongoing expense monitoring

## 2. NerdWallet Budget Calculator

**Best for:** Getting a quick snapshot based on the 50/30/20 rule

[NerdWallet's calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/finance/learn/nerdwallet-budget-calculator) is one of the simplest budget tools online. You enter your monthly after-tax income, and it instantly splits it into three buckets: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment.

It's a good starting point if you've never budgeted before and want a baseline. The tool also lets you adjust the percentages if the standard split doesn't fit your situation — say you live somewhere expensive where rent eats more than 50% of your income.

### What's good

* Extremely simple — takes less than a minute
* No account required
* Clear visual breakdown of your income

### What's missing

* Doesn't help with specific purchase decisions
* Very generic — same framework for everyone regardless of lifestyle
* NerdWallet recently shut down some budgeting features in their app (August 2025), so the tool's future is uncertain

## 3. EveryDollar

**Best for:** Zero-based budgeting (assigning every dollar a job)

[EveryDollar](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/money/everydollar) comes from Dave Ramsey's team and follows the zero-based budgeting method — every dollar of income gets assigned to a specific category until you hit zero. The idea is that unassigned money tends to get spent on nothing in particular.

The app relaunched in January 2026 with new features including personalized plans, daily lessons, and group coaching. The free version works well, though you'll need to enter transactions manually — bank syncing requires the paid plan.

### What's good

* Strong methodology for people who want tight control over spending
* Clean, well-designed app
* Good educational content built in

### What's missing

* Manual transaction entry on the free plan (no bank syncing)
* Philosophically rigid — the Ramsey method isn't for everyone
* More of a full budgeting system than a quick calculator

## 4. PocketGuard

**Best for:** Seeing how much you have left to spend after bills

[PocketGuard](https://pocketguard.com/) takes a different approach: instead of asking you to categorize everything, it connects to your bank accounts and shows you one key number — how much you have left to spend safely after covering bills, debt, and savings goals.

It also includes a subscription manager that can flag recurring charges you might have forgotten about. The free tier covers the basics, though advanced features like custom categories require the paid version.

### What's good

* Automatic bank syncing on the free plan
* The "In My Pocket" number is genuinely useful
* Subscription tracker catches forgotten charges

### What's missing

* Requires linking your bank accounts (some people aren't comfortable with that)
* Doesn't help you evaluate specific purchases
* Free tier is limited compared to what it used to be

## 5. Calculator.net Budget Calculator

**Best for:** A no-frills, spreadsheet-style budget overview

If you want something completely basic with no app to download and no account to create, [Calculator.net's budget calculator](https://www.calculator.net/budget-calculator.html) gets the job done. You enter income and expenses across standard categories (housing, food, transport, healthcare), and it gives you a summary with your debt-to-income ratio.

It also offers a downloadable budget template if you want to track things monthly in a spreadsheet. Nothing fancy — but that's the point.

### What's good

* Completely free, no account, no app
* Covers a wide range of expense categories
* Good for people who prefer a spreadsheet-style approach

### What's missing

* Dated interface — feels like it hasn't been updated in years
* No mobile app
* Purely a calculator — no ongoing tracking, no insights, no recommendations
