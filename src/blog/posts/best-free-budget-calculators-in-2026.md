Most budget calculators ask the same question: "Where did your money go last month?" Which, sure, is useful. But it's not usually what people actually want to know.

What most people want to know is: *"Can I afford this thing?"* Or: *"Am I spending too much on stuff that doesn't matter to me?"*

Some of the tools below are great at answering those questions. Others are better if you want full control of every dollar. And one of them looks like it hasn't been updated since 2012 (but still works, so it makes the list).

Here are five free budget calculators worth trying, what each one is actually good for, and a few honest opinions you won't find in most roundups.

## **1. Is This Worth My Money?**

**Best for:** Deciding whether a specific purchase is worth it

Most budgeting tools are built around tracking. You connect your bank, categorize your transactions, look at charts. That's fine if you're into it, but it doesn't help much when you're standing in a store wondering if you should buy something.

[Is This Worth My Money?](https://isthisworthmymoney.com/) is built for that exact moment. It has three calculators: one for recurring purchases (like a streaming subscription or your daily coffee run), one for bigger one-time buys, and one that breaks down your full monthly spending.

You plug in the cost and your income, and it shows you what that purchase actually costs you over time. Not just the sticker price, but how it fits into your overall financial picture. It takes about 30 seconds, no account needed.

The thing I appreciate most is that it doesn't lecture you. It's not trying to guilt you out of buying things. It just gives you the numbers so you can make your own call.

**The trade-off:** It's not a full budgeting system. There's no bank syncing or transaction tracking. If you want something that monitors your spending month to month, you'll need to pair it with another tool.

## **2. NerdWallet Budget Calculator**

**Best for:** A quick starting point if you've literally never budgeted

<img src="/blog/images/Blog/1/nerdwallet.jpg" alt="Nerd Wallet" style="max-width: 200px;">

NerdWallet's calculator does one thing: you type in your monthly after-tax income, and it splits it using the 50/30/20 rule. 50% for needs, 30% for wants, 20% for savings and debt. Done.

If you have no idea where to start, this gives you a rough framework in under a minute. You can also tweak the percentages, which is good because the 50/30/20 split is pretty unrealistic if you live somewhere with high rent.

But that's basically all it does. It won't help you decide whether a specific purchase makes sense, and it doesn't know anything about your actual spending. It's a starting line, not a finish line.

One thing worth mentioning: NerdWallet shut down several budgeting features in their app back in August 2025. The calculator still works on their site for now, but I'd keep that in mind if you're thinking about building a long-term habit around their tools.

## **3. EveryDollar**

**Best for:** People who want to assign every single dollar a job

EveryDollar is Dave Ramsey's budgeting app, and it follows zero-based budgeting. The idea is simple: you take your income and assign every dollar to a category (rent, groceries, gas, savings, whatever) until you hit zero. No unaccounted-for money floating around.

The app got a big update in January 2026 with personalized plans, daily lessons, and group coaching. If you like the Ramsey approach to money, it's a solid app.

If you *don't* like the Ramsey approach, this will probably annoy you. It's opinionated by design. The free version also requires you to enter every transaction manually, which is a dealbreaker for a lot of people. Bank syncing is locked behind the paid plan.

This is less of a quick calculator and more of a full budgeting system. If you want something you can check in 30 seconds, this isn't it. If you want something you commit to daily, it could work well.

## **4. PocketGuard**

**Best for:** People who want their budget to run on autopilot

PocketGuard connects to your bank accounts and boils your finances down to one number: how much you can safely spend right now, after accounting for bills, debt payments, and savings goals. They call it your "In My Pocket" number.

For people who hate manual tracking, this is appealing. It also has a subscription manager that can catch recurring charges you forgot about (we've all been paying for something we don't use).

The downside is that you have to link your bank accounts, and not everyone is comfortable with that. The free tier has also gotten more limited over time. Features that used to be free now require the paid version. It's still useful on the free plan, but don't expect the full experience.

Like EveryDollar, this is more of an ongoing budgeting app than a quick calculator. It won't help you evaluate a specific purchase. It just tells you how much room you have.

## **5. Calculator.net Budget Calculator**

**Best for:** People who just want a plain, no-nonsense budget overview

I'll be honest: Calculator.net looks like it was built a long time ago and never really updated. The interface is basic. There's no app. There's no design to speak of.

But it works. You enter your income and expenses across standard categories (housing, food, transport, healthcare, etc.), and it gives you a summary with your debt-to-income ratio. That's it. You can also download a budget template if you want to track things in a spreadsheet.

If you're the kind of person who just wants a simple calculation without creating an account, downloading an app, or connecting your bank, this does the job. Just don't expect it to look pretty or give you any advice.
