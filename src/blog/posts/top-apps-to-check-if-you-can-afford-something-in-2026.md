You're about to buy something and a little voice in your head goes: "Wait, can I actually afford this?"

It's a surprisingly hard question to answer. Not because the math is complicated, but because most financial apps aren't really built for that moment. They're built for *after* you've already spent the money. They want to categorize your transactions, show you pie charts, tell you that you spent 23% more on dining out this month.

Cool. But that doesn't help you right now, standing in a store or hovering over a checkout button. Here are six worth knowing about, starting with the ones that answer the "can I afford this?" question most directly.

## **1. Is This Worth My Money?**

![Is this worth my money](/blog/images/logo-articles-.png)

* **In a nutshell:** A set of three free calculators that show you what a purchase actually costs in the context of your full financial picture. One for recurring expenses, one for one-time buys, one for your monthly budget. No account, no app, no bank linking. Just plug in numbers and get an answer in about 30 seconds.
* **Use it when:** You're standing in a store, hovering over a checkout button, or debating whether to sign up for another subscription. You want a quick, honest number before you commit.
* **Why I picked it:** It's the only tool on this list built specifically for the moment *before* a purchase. Everything else is a budgeting app that can sort of help with that question. This one answers it directly. I also like that it doesn't lecture you or flash "DENIED" at you. It gives you the math and lets you make your own call. The recurring cost calculator is especially eye-opening. A $15/month subscription doesn't sound like much until you see it stacked up over five years.
* **The trade-off:** It's a calculator, not a tracking app. It doesn't connect to your bank or monitor spending over time. You bring the numbers, it does the math. For ongoing budget monitoring, you'll want to pair it with something else on this list.

## **2. PocketGuard**

![Pocket Guard](/blog/images/1-pocketguard.png)

* **In a nutshell:** A budgeting app that connects to your bank and boils everything down to one number: how much you can safely spend right now. It calls this your "In My Pocket" amount, calculated after accounting for bills, debt payments, and savings goals.
* **Use it when:** You don't want to do any math yourself. You just want to open an app, see a number, and know whether you have room to spend.
* **Why I picked it:** It's the closest thing to a direct "can I afford this?" answer among full budgeting apps. You don't need to dig through categories or check budget lines. One number, front and center. It also has a subscription tracker that surfaces recurring charges you've forgotten about, which is a nice bonus.
* **The trade-off:** The free version is basically a 7-day trial now. After that, you're looking at $13/month or $75/year. So "can I afford PocketGuard?" is actually the first affordability question you'll need to answer. You also have to be comfortable linking your bank accounts. Some people are fine with that, others aren't. No judgment either way.

## **3. Rocket Money**

![Rocket Money](/blog/images/2-rocketmoney.webp)

* **In a nutshell:** A personal finance app that finds all the recurring charges you're paying for and helps you cut the ones you don't need. It'll even negotiate bills on your behalf (though it takes a cut of the savings). Also includes basic budgeting and spending tracking.
* **Use it when:** You suspect the answer to "can I afford this?" might be "yes, if I stop paying for three things I forgot about." Rocket Money is good at surfacing that dead weight before you make a new spending decision.
* **Why I picked it:** It approaches affordability from a different angle than everything else here. Instead of telling you whether you can afford the next purchase, it helps you reclaim money you're already wasting. That's often the more useful first step. The free version lets you track subscriptions and see basic spending. Premium ($7-14/month, you choose what to pay) adds cancellation help, net worth tracking, and more detailed budgets.
* **The trade-off:** The budgeting features are decent but not the main draw. If you want a serious budgeting tool, YNAB or Monarch do it better. And the bill negotiation, while genuinely useful, comes with a fee: Rocket Money keeps a percentage of whatever they save you. Think of it as a leak-fixer, not a full budgeting system.

## **4. YNAB (You Need a Budget)**

![YNAB](/blog/images/2-ynab.png)

* **In a nutshell:** A zero-based budgeting app where you assign every dollar you earn to a specific job: rent, groceries, savings, fun money, whatever. When you want to buy something, you check the category. Money there? You can afford it. No money? You move funds from another category or you wait.
* **Use it when:** You want to stop asking "can I afford this?" altogether. YNAB's whole philosophy is that if you budget properly, you already know the answer before you walk into the store.
* **Why I picked it:** People who stick with YNAB swear by it, and the results back that up. The system genuinely changes how you think about money over time. The 34-day free trial is unusually generous, and college students get a full year free. It's the most thorough answer to the affordability question on this list, just not the fastest one.
* **The trade-off:** It requires real commitment. You need to set up your budget, assign every dollar, and keep it updated. This is not a "check it for 30 seconds" kind of app. It's a daily practice. At $14.99/month or $109/year, it's also one of the pricier options. And if the words "assign every dollar a job" make you want to close this tab, it's probably not for you.

## **5. Monarch Money**

![Monarch Money](/blog/images/2-monarch.webp)

* **In a nutshell:** A full financial dashboard that covers budgeting, net worth tracking, investment monitoring, and goal planning. It became the go-to for a lot of people after Mint shut down in 2024, especially couples and families who share finances.
* **Use it when:** You share finances with a partner and want both of you looking at the same numbers when someone asks "can we afford this?" Also useful if you want a single place to see spending, investments, and net worth together.
* **Why I picked it:** The collaboration features are the real selling point. Both partners see the same dashboard, which makes joint financial decisions way less stressful. For the "can I afford this?" question, it helps indirectly. You can check your budget, see your cash flow, and look at how you're tracking for the month. It doesn't give you one clean number like PocketGuard, but it gives you more context.
* **The trade-off:** No free tier. It's $14.99/month or $99.99/year with a 7-day trial. The interface is clean and well-designed, which matters for building a habit. But if you're a solo budgeter who just wants a quick affordability check, it might be more than you need.

## **6. EveryDollar**

![Every Dollar](/blog/images/1-everydollar.jpg)

![]()

* **In a nutshell:** Dave Ramsey's zero-based budgeting app. Like YNAB, you assign every dollar to a category at the start of the month, then track whether you're sticking to it. The basic version is free.
* **Use it when:** You want the structure of zero-based budgeting without paying for it. You look at your categories, see what's left, and make your decision.
* **Why I picked it:** It's the best free option on this list for structured budgeting. The January 2026 update added personalized plans, daily lessons, and group coaching, which is nice if you're into the Ramsey method. For affordability checks, it works the same way as YNAB: check the category, see the balance, decide accordingly.
* **The trade-off:** The free version requires manual entry for everything. Every coffee, every grocery run, every subscription. You type it in yourself. Bank syncing is only in the premium version (Ramsey+ at $49.99/quarter). If you know yourself well enough to know you won't keep up with manual entry, the free version is going to become a very pretty app you never open. The Ramsey philosophy is also baked into the app. If phrases like "debt snowball" and "baby steps" resonate with you, it'll feel like home. If they don't, the opinionated approach might rub you the wrong way.

## **Which one should you use?**

**You want a quick answer right now, no setup.**[ Is This Worth My Money?](https://isthisworthmymoney.com) gives you the math in under a minute. No account, no app, no commitment.

**You want one number that tells you what's safe to spend.** PocketGuard does the heavy lifting once you connect your accounts, though you'll need the paid plan.

**You're probably wasting money on subscriptions and want to fix that first.** Rocket Money will find the leaks. Start there, then figure out your budget.

**You want to never wonder "can I afford this?" again.** YNAB builds a system where every dollar is accounted for. It's work, but it works.

**You share finances with someone.** Monarch Money gives both of you the same view, which makes joint financial decisions way less stressful.

**You want structure without paying for it.** EveryDollar's free version is solid if you're willing to enter transactions manually.

And honestly? The most useful setup might be two of these together. A quick calculator for in-the-moment purchase decisions and a budgeting app for the bigger picture. They answer different questions, and both questions matter.
