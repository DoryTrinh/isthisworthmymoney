  they're worth it.

Try to guess how many subscriptions you're paying for right now. Now add up what they cost per month. Got a number? Good. 
**Now I'll bet the real number is higher.**
When researchers asked people to estimate their monthly subscription spending, most guessed around $80. The actual average was over $200. That's not a small gap. That's people forgetting they're paying for stuff every single month.
And it makes sense. Each one felt like nothing when you signed up:

That's **$157/month** just from this list. Yours probably has more. Add a second streaming service, a news site, maybe a cloud storage upgrade, and you're past $200 easily.

**$200/month = $2,400/year. That's a vacation. That's 4 months of car payments. That's not nothing.**

## **The three piles**

Once you've gone through your list, every subscription goes into one of three piles:

## **See what your subscriptions actually cost you**

Add up everything you're keeping and plug it into our recurring expense calculator. It'll show you what that monthly total really looks like over a year, and how many hours of work it takes to pay for it.

There's something about seeing "$11/month for Spotify" turn into "6 hours of your life per year" that makes you think differently about it.

## **How to actually do this**

**The "Cancel Everything" Challenge** 

Cancel every single subscription today. All of them. Then over the next month, only re-subscribe to the ones you actually miss enough to go sign up again. Most people end up re-subscribing to 2-3 out of 8-10. The rest? You won't even notice they're gone.

**The "Pay It Manually" Test** 

Turn off auto-renew on everything. When the next billing date hits, you'll get a notification asking you to pay. That 3-second moment of "do I want to pull out my card for this?" tells you more than any audit ever will.

**The Screenshot Method** 

Screenshot your bank and credit card statements right now. Circle every recurring charge. Set that screenshot as your phone wallpaper for a week. Sounds dramatic, but staring at it every time you unlock your phone makes the total impossible to ignore.

**The "Explain It to Someone" Test** 

Read each subscription out loud to a friend or partner and explain why you pay for it. If you feel embarrassed saying "I pay $15/month for a meditation app I opened twice," that's your answer.

Once you know what to cut, ask yourself one question:

**"If I wasn't already subscribed, would I sign up for this today?"**

Not "do I use it sometimes." Not "might I need it eventually." Would you pull out your card and pay for it right now, today, knowing what it costs?

If the answer is no, cancel it. You can always re-subscribe later if you actually miss it. *(Spoiler: you probably won't.)*
