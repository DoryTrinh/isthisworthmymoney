Subscriptions are the silent budget killers. They're designed to be forgettable — you sign up, the charges auto-renew, and before you know it you're paying for six streaming services, three productivity apps, and a gym you haven't visited since January.

## The subscription creep problem

Most people underestimate how much they spend on subscriptions by 2-3x. When researchers asked consumers to estimate their monthly subscription costs, the average guess was around $80. The actual average? Over $200.

Why? Because each subscription feels small on its own:

- Netflix: $15
- Spotify: $11
- iCloud storage: $3
- Gym: $40
- Adobe Creative Cloud: $55
- A meal kit service: $60
- That app you tried once: $8

Individually, each seems reasonable. Together, they're $192/month — that's $2,304/year.

## The 4-step subscription audit

### Step 1: Find every subscription

Check these places:
- Your bank and credit card statements (last 3 months)
- Your email inbox (search for "receipt", "renewal", "subscription")
- App Store / Google Play subscription settings
- PayPal recurring payments

### Step 2: Categorize each one

For each subscription, ask:

1. **When did I last use this?** If it's been over a month, it's a candidate for cutting
2. **Could I use a free alternative?** Many paid tools have free versions that work fine
3. **Would I buy this again today?** If you weren't already subscribed, would you sign up right now?

### Step 3: Take action

Sort your subscriptions into three piles:

- **Keep**: You use it regularly and it brings value
- **Downgrade**: You use it but could switch to a cheaper tier or free alternative
- **Cancel**: You forgot you had it, or you rarely use it

### Step 4: Set a reminder

Put a quarterly reminder in your calendar to review subscriptions again. New ones sneak in faster than you'd think.

## The bottom line

You don't need to cancel everything. You need to cancel the things you're paying for out of inertia rather than intention. A 30-minute subscription audit could easily save you $50-100/month — that's up to $1,200/year back in your pocket.
