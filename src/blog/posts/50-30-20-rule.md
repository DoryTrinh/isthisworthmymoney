If you've never budgeted before and don't know where to start, the 50/30/20 rule is the simplest framework that actually works. It was popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren in her book *All Your Worth*.

## How it works

Take your after-tax monthly income and split it into three buckets:

- **50% — Needs**: Housing, utilities, groceries, insurance, minimum debt payments, transport to work
- **30% — Wants**: Dining out, entertainment, hobbies, subscriptions, shopping
- **20% — Savings & debt**: Emergency fund, investments, extra debt payments

## A real example

Let's say you earn $4,000/month after tax:

| Category | Percentage | Amount |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Needs | 50% | $2,000 |
| Wants | 30% | $1,200 |
| Savings | 20% | $800 |

## Where most people go wrong

The biggest mistake is miscategorizing wants as needs. Here's a quick test:

- **Need**: A reliable car to get to work
- **Want**: A brand-new SUV with leather seats

- **Need**: A phone plan
- **Want**: The latest iPhone every year

- **Need**: Groceries
- **Want**: Eating out every night

> Be honest with yourself about what's a need and what's a want. There's nothing wrong with wants — they just belong in the right bucket.

## What if your needs are over 50%?

If you live in an expensive city, your housing alone might eat 40% of your income. That's okay — adjust the percentages to fit your reality. The principle still works:

- **60/20/20** if housing is expensive
- **50/25/25** if you're aggressively paying down debt
- **40/30/30** if you have low expenses and want to save more

The point is having a framework, not following it rigidly.

## Getting started today

1. Calculate your after-tax monthly income
2. List your fixed needs (rent, utilities, insurance)
3. Track your wants for one week
4. Set up an automatic transfer for savings

The 50/30/20 rule isn't about restriction — it's about giving every dollar a purpose.
