We've all heard it before: "Just skip the latte and you'll be rich." While that's an oversimplification, the core idea has real merit. Small, repeated purchases are sneaky — they feel insignificant in the moment but compound into serious money over time.

## What is the Latte Factor?

The term was coined by financial author David Bach. The concept is simple: identify small, recurring expenses you don't think about, and calculate their true annual cost.

Here are some common examples:

- **Daily coffee shop visit** ($5/day) = $1,825/year
- **Lunch out at work** ($12/day, 5x/week) = $3,120/year
- **Streaming services** ($15/month x 4 services) = $720/year
- **Impulse snacks** ($3/day) = $1,095/year

> The point isn't that you should never buy coffee. It's that you should know what it's really costing you.

## Try it yourself

## The real question: Is it worth it?

Not all spending is bad. A daily coffee might genuinely be the best part of your morning. The goal isn't to eliminate joy — it's to make *intentional* choices.

Ask yourself these three questions:

1. **Do I actively enjoy this?** Or is it just a habit?
2. **Could I get the same joy cheaper?** (e.g., making coffee at home)
3. **What else could this money do?** Would you rather have a vacation fund?

## The 30-day experiment

Try this: pick one small daily expense and cut it for 30 days. Transfer the money you'd normally spend into a savings account. At the end of the month, see how much you saved and decide if the trade-off was worth it.

## The bottom line

Small purchases aren't the enemy. Unconscious spending is. Once you know where your money goes, you can make choices that align with what actually matters to you.
