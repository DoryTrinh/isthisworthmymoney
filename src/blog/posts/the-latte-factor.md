A $5 latte every weekday doesn't feel like a financial decision. It feels like a Tuesday.

But run the numbers and it gets uncomfortable fast:

<div class="blog-callout">
  <div class="blog-callout-body">**$5/day, 5 days a week** = $1,300/year

**$5/day, every day** = $1,825/year

**Over 10 years** (invested at 7%) = roughly **$25,000**

</div>
</div>

That last one is the one that stings.

Financial author David Bach came up with the term "latte factor" to describe this exact thing: small, daily purchases that feel like nothing but quietly add up to a lot. And coffee is just the obvious example. Here are a few others:

| Daily habit                  | Cost   | Annual total |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Lunch out at work (5x/week)  | $14    | $3,640       |
| Afternoon snack run          | $4     | $1,460       |
| 4 streaming services         | $60/mo | $720         |
| Bottled water instead of tap | $2     | $730         |
| Parking instead of transit   | $8     | $2,080       |

Add a few of those together and you're looking at $5,000-8,000 a year on things you barely think about.

## So should you stop buying coffee?

No. That's the wrong takeaway, and it's the reason people roll their eyes at the latte factor.

The point isn't "stop spending money on things you enjoy." The point is "know what you're spending." Those are very different things.

If your morning coffee is genuinely the highlight of your day, keep buying it. Seriously. But if you're grabbing it out of habit and you'd be just as happy with the $0.50 cup you make at home, that's $1,200 a year you could put somewhere that matters more to you.

The only person who can make that call is you. You just need the numbers first.

## A quick way to check

Pick any small purchase you make regularly and run it through our [recurring expense calculator](https://isthisworthmymoney.com). It takes about 15 seconds and shows you the annual cost relative to your income.

You might look at the number and think "yeah, totally worth it." Or you might think "wait, I'm spending *that* much on energy drinks?" Either way, you'll know.

## The real question: Is it worth it?

Not all spending is bad. A daily coffee might genuinely be the best part of your morning. The goal isn't to eliminate joy — it's to make *intentional* choices.

Ask yourself these three questions:

1. **Do I actively enjoy this?** Or is it just a habit?
2. **Could I get the same joy cheaper?** (e.g., making coffee at home)
3. **What else could this money do?** Would you rather have a vacation fund?

## The 30-day experiment

Try this: pick one small daily expense and cut it for 30 days. Transfer the money you'd normally spend into a savings account. At the end of the month, see how much you saved and decide if the trade-off was worth it.

## The bottom line

Small purchases aren't the enemy. Unconscious spending is. Once you know where your money goes, you can make choices that align with what actually matters to you.
